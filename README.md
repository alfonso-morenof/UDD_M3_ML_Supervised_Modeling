# UDD_M3_ML_Supervised_Modeling

## General Context
In this project, supervised modeling techniques in Machine Learning are applied and consolidated, focusing on two main approaches: linear regression and logistic regression. The work uses real data from surveys applied to prospective university students, allowing the analysis of both numerical and categorical variables.

The documentation is clear and detailed, justifying each decision and applying current best practices in data science.

## Project Objectives
- Implement and analyze a linear regression model to predict relevant numerical variables using the dataset `rrhh.csv`.
- Implement and analyze a logistic regression model to predict categorical variables using the dataset `rrhh_2.csv`.
- Perform exhaustive preprocessing of the data: identify and handle missing values, outliers, and select relevant variables.
- Split the data into training and validation sets to properly evaluate model performance.
- Apply and explain the main evaluation metrics for each model (MAE, MSE, RÂ² for regression; accuracy and confusion matrix for classification).
- Communicate the results clearly, professionally, and with justification, prioritizing applied interpretation and practical recommendations.

## General Structure of the Project

1. **First part:**  
   Work with the `rrhh.csv` dataset, which contains variables such as gender, age, number of children, maximum years of schooling, maximum number of failed exams, among others. The goal is to predict numerical variables using linear regression, applying all stages of a professional data science workflow.

2. **Second part:**  
   Use the `rrhh_2.csv` dataset to apply a logistic regression model aimed at predicting categorical variables (for example, passing or failing a subject). Variable selection, training, evaluation, and detailed analysis of performance metrics will be performed.

## Project Files
